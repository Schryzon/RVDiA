# RVDiA
## "Revolusioner, Virtual, Independen."
Revolutionary Virtual Discord Assistant (RVDiA) is an **Indonesian-oriented Multipurpose Discord Bot**.

## What's Special About This Bot?
This bot is in Indonesian and has special commands for members of the G-Tech Re'sman club. It also offers a variety of utilities and its own RPG (role-playing game) system with exciting events.

## Want to Tinker with It Yourself?
1. Clone this repo or download the latest release from tags;
2. Get a Discord bot token & Top.gg token;
3. Get a MongoDB URI;
4. Get an OpenWeather API key and an OpenAI key.
* There might be more necessities.

(For the `.env` format, check out `secrets.env.example`. Remember to keep your bot secure!)

## Additional Information
This project is __just for fun__ and to improve my programming skills regarding virtual bots and web apps.

Currently, RVDiA is hosted using DigitalOcean. So, if you want to run bot, I recommend using DigitalOcean's services. But, if you just want to run the bot locally on your personal computer, that's no problem.

Run `python RVDIA.py` to start the bot.

If you want, you can also run `python Xelvie.py`to scout for status changes on the bot.

Join the [CyroN Central server](https://discord.gg/QqWCnk6zxw) on Discord and contact me (Schryzon) if you have any issues, questions, or want to collaborate on RVDiA's development.
